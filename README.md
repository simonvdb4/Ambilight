# Ambilight
Ambilight project for monitor (handy if you watch tv, movie or a serie on your monitor from a distance)

## Requirements
* Arduino Nano (or other Arduino board but the Nano is priced very low)
* Solder station 
* WS2812B led strip (the length depends on the size of your monitor)
* Double-sided tape (Optional, this was needed in my case because the glue on the back of the led strip was not strong enough to keep them stick on the back of my monitor)
* Some wires (to solder the ledstrip parts together)
*
